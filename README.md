# Clean My Things

Used RoR and SQLite:
*  First cause this is my favorite framework on ruby.
*  Second cause it fits well for that little task.


## Task

### Explain shortly how you will do the following (make appropriate drawings or documentation):
### Identify all necessary parameter that are transmitted to the backend end-point, in order to receive all available time slots 
### Clarify in which step the backend function should be called
### Under which circumstances is it necessary to recall the function?
### Roughly sketch out the data model (table structure) of this particular part of the application

I created a hude table /slots/ with both slot's information and user information because i have not implement user's registration so i simple leave it like this.
Look at [schema.rb](https://github.com/developer88/cleanmythings/db/schema.rb "schema.rb")
